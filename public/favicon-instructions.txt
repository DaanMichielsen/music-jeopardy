Favicon Generation Instructions:

1. The SVG favicon has been created at /public/favicon.svg
2. To generate additional formats:
   - Visit favicon.io and upload the SVG
   - Or use a tool like Figma/Sketch to export in different sizes
   - Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 192x192, 512x512

3. Place the generated files in the /public directory:
   - favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32)
   - apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
   - icon-192.png (192x192)
   - icon-512.png (512x512)

4. The layout.tsx file has been updated to include favicon metadata.
